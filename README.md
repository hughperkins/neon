# What's this branch?

This fork is a stripped down version of neon, with only the convolution layer, no other layers
or ... anything really.  Just pure convolution.  Also, no sass.  Just Kepler convolutions.

The original neon, documentation etc is at https://github.com/nervanasystems/neon

## How to run something with it?

Test code is at:
- [test_neon1.py](test_neon1.py)  More for timing purposes
- [test_neon2.py](test_neon2.py)  More for correctness purposes
